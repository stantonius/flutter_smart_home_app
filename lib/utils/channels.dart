/// Must have the following:
/// 1. A singleton instance to ensure that the channel is only created once
/// 2. Channel method logic to sort the different channel calls
/// 3. A method that accepts the initial beacon class parameters
///
/// Took inspiration from https://github.com/alann-maulana/flutter_beacon/blob/master/lib/flutter_beacon.dart
///
/// Note we could handle all of the permissions and check the bluetooth settings in the native Kotlin code
/// as the library above does. However just to simplify things we will only turn the beacon on
/// and off in this implementation and handle the permissions and bluetooth settings in the top level dart code
///
/// Therefore we need 3 methods:
/// 1. startBroadcastBeacon
/// 2. stopBroadcastBeacon
/// 3. isBroadcasting
