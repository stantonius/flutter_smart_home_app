# Flutter Smart Home App

## Objective

1. Advertise as beacon for in-home position tracking.
2. Interface to store other smart home/IoT settings (switches, video feeds eventually)

## Status

Very much in progress. It does work though as an iBeacon.

## Features

* Advertises in the background as iBeacon
* Connects to home Raspberry Pi server (specifically to Mosquitto MQTT protocol).
* Acts as an activity tracker and has geofencing set up
* Currently only for Android (although every library purposely chosen with iPhone compatability in mind).

## ToDo
- [x] Turn off beacon when leaving geofence
- [x] Enable light switch to turn on/off lights via Node-Red/MQTT
- [x] Properly disable all features if not at home
- [ ] Handle when device bluetooth turns on/off
- [ ] Enable remote access

## Useful Resources

* Using a secrets.dart file that is hidden from version control but still works with Github Actions: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67998780/9739375
